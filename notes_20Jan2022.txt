Lab setup for Angular:
------------

i) node js	(download node js) and install it your PC		You will get npm
ii) couple of commands to execute to install
	typescript
	angular
iii) download and install visual studio code	(vs code) is absolutely free of cost	(NOT visual studio)

You all have completed these steps.
-------------------------------------------

Lets start with Angular
-------------------------
create an angular project:
i) ng new first-angular-project --style=css --routing

	create a folder structure
		by default a modue will be there
			app		(module)
		inside that app module, there will be a component also created by default
			AppComponent
	
For every component, what are the files created?
		app.component.html			(template)
		app.component.ts			(code)
		app.component.css			(style)
		app.component.spec.ts			(test cases		karma-jasmine)


For every component, there is a selector and it is defined in the .ts file
wherever you want to plug this component, you have to use the selector.

index.html
	under <body>
		this app component is plugged
		<app-root><app-root>


How to run and test an angular project locally?
	ng serve -o

once you add the bootstrap cdn (or jquery cdn) in index.html (head portion), it is applied to all the chid components.

app component can be used for scaffolding
	like structure of the website
		in every portions, just plug in the child components

How to create a component?
	ng g c signup
	ng generate component signup
		both commands are same

creating a component, includes declaring it in the app.module.ts


1) create an angular project
2) create lot of components
3) create a scaffolding in app component
4) plug the components in various portions of the app component

NOTICE the app.module.ts declarations that happen when you create a component.
You should be able to delete a component and update app module also.

If cmd prompt error does not refresh, use ctrl+c (only once).
